%% Compute the phase shifts across subcarriers as a function of ToF
% tau             -- the time of flight (ToF)
% frequency_delta -- the frequency difference between adjacent subcarriers
% Return:
% time_phase      -- complex exponential representing the phase shift from time of flight
function time_phase = omega_tof_phase(tau, sub_freq_delta)
    time_phase = exp(-1i * 2 * pi * sub_freq_delta * tau);
